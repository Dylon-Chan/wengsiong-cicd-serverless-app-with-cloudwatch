## Assignment

### Brief

The objective of this assignment is to set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Node.js application that is deployed on a serverless platform with Logging and Monitoring in placed!.

Instructions:

1. Create a new Node.js application using the Express framework.
2. Set up automatic testing for the application using a testing framework such as Jest or Mocha.
3. Create new branch on your existing repository.
4. Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a tool such as Github Action, Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI.
5. Configure the pipeline to automatically build and test the code whenever changes are pushed to the code repository.
6. Deploy the application to a serverless platform such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.
7. Store some information using Secret Management on AWS, then get the information as part of the pipeline.
8. Configure the pipeline to automatically deploy the code to the serverless platform whenever changes are pushed to the code repository and all tests pass.
9. **Add some logging on your application**
10. **Retrieve your logging information from AWS Cloudwatch**
11. **Add that logging information on new file and commit it to your github repo**


Deliverables:

- The Node.js application with automatic testing set up
- Code repository with the CI/CD pipeline configured
- Documentation explaining the steps taken to set up the pipeline.
